Welcome to my most recent project, this is Argentina Guessing Game, this program is based on one of the projects from the course [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) by Angela Yu.
This program proposes to guess the name of the provinces of Argentina, as this happens the map is completed little by little. Below I leave a small demonstration of how it works, in addition to obviously the code so that whoever wants can see it and even make their own version.
